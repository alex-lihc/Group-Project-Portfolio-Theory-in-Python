## Project Description

This project is aimed to conduct the fiancial portfolio theory with python. We are going to collect data for some randomly chosen U.S. stocks and visualize their time series. After calculating important statistics for these stocks, we are going to compute and visualize mean-variance portfolio optimization with two different methods. At the end, we compare the investment performance of different portfolios.

## Instruction

All steps have been tested on windows platform and anaconda. 

Notice you need to import every packages before runing the codes.
Following required versions for packages are needed:

python 3.7.9

pandas 1.1.3

numpy 1.19.2

pandas_datareader 0.9.0

datetime

matplotlib  3.3.2

scipy 1.5.3


## Data

Currently, the analysis are done based on stock price data from 2018-01-01 to 2020-11-30. The data is retrieved from the website Yahoo Finance ("finance.yahoo.com")
