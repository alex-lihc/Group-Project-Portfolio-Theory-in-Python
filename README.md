## Project Description

This project is aimed to conduct the fiancial portfolio theory with python. We are going to collect data for some U.S. stocks and visualize their time series. After calculating important statistics for these stocks, we are going to compute and visualize mean-variance portfolio optimization with different methods. At the end, we compare the investment performance of different portfolios.

## Instruction

All steps have been tested on windows platform and anaconda. 

Notice you need to import every packages before runing the codes.

## Data

Currently, the analysis are done based on stock price data from 2018-01-01 to the end of November, 2020. As the data collecting set the end date as the most recent date, it could automatically update the results, which is one of the advantage we want to deliver. So, don't be confused if the results are not matched.
